        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am currently a third year <b>Computer Science</b> major studying at <i><abbr title="University of California, San Diego">UCSD</abbr></i> full time. I was born and raised in Chula Vista, where I still live today. As the oldest of two sibilings you can say I've grown to enjoy assuming a leadership position and a passion for problem-solving.
        <br>
        I’m particularly interested in the technical side of marketing, with a focus on the development behind user experience and how it drives engagement</p>
